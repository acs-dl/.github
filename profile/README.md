# Access Control System: README

## Project Overview
The Access Control System (ACS) is an advanced tool designed to manage and regulate access to digital resources across several modules, including GitLab, GitHub, Telegram, and Email. This project aims to provide a secure and efficient way to manage access permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.

## Features

**Multi-Module Monitoring:** ACS uses official service APIs to asynchronously track activity across the aforementioned modules. This ensures your confidential information is well-protected and accessible only to authorized personnel. ![Modules](./assets/modules.jpeg)

**Status of Requests Window:** This feature allows you to monitor all queues in real-time, providing instant updates on every request and change happening within the system. ![Status window](./assets/status_window.jpg)

**User Management:** ACS offers a detailed view of both verified and unverified users. You can manually add or delete users from these lists, providing a flexible approach to user management. Furthermore, you can view detailed profiles of verified users, including their module access levels. ![Verified list](./assets/verified_list.jpg) ![Unverified list](./assets/unverified_list.jpg) ![Details page](./assets/details.jpg)

**Customizable Indexing:** The system indexes all modules at a user-defined frequency. This allows for a tailored approach to access management, ensuring that the system aligns with your specific workflow.

**Refresh Function:** This feature allows you to manually update the entire system, an individual module, or a submodule as per your needs. This ensures that your system is always up-to-date. ![Refresh page](./assets/refresh_window.jpg)
